Breakdown :
This Dockerfile builds a lightweight Java 17 application image.
It starts from the Eclipse Temurin JDK 17 base image on Alpine Linux, exposes port 8080, sets an application directory using environment variables, copies the JAR file, and finally runs it using the java -jar command.
The WORKDIR ensures all commands run inside the app directory, and the image remains clean and organized.
